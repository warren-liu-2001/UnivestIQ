## An app to help university students figure out how to save money and grow their money!

University students usually struggle to save money, due to our lesser financial status and literacy. UnivestIQ, a parody of the famous and quite respectable S&P CapitalIQ, is an app that tries not to dump dizzying amounts of information to already confused students. Instead, it analyzes your purchases, and instead recommends you how to save money, and also recommends securities to you, while providing detailed information about expected returns with your investment.
