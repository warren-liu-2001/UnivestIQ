# UnivestIQ

## An app to help university students figure out how to save money and grow their money!

University students usually struggle to save money, due to a lack of financial literacy and security. UnivestIQ, a parody of the famous and quite respectable S&P CapitalIQ, is an app that tries not to dump dizzying amounts of information to already confused students. Instead, it analyzes your purchases, and instead recommends you how to save money, and also shows you what potential you have by investing in key securities!
